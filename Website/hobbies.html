                <p>
                    I've been playing the piano since I was 12, self-taught. I play a variety of genres, but mainly
                    focus on video game and film music.

                <h2>Drawing ‚úèÔ∏è</h2>
                <p>
                    I love drawing. I took lessons for three years, but I stopped because I don't like being told what
                    to draw. I prefer to draw when I feel like it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Primarily, I draw in a manga style digitally, but I also enjoy realistic drawings in traditional
                    media.

                    For the past year and a half, I've been doing weightlifting. It's
                    really great; it helps me clear my mind, take some time for myself during the day, be alone with my
                    thoughts, and not think about anything.

                <h2>Video Games üéÆ</h2>
                <p>
                    Video games are also a big part of my life. Right now, with my studies and extracurricular
                    activities, I have less time, but whenever I have a bit of free time, I play Geometry Dash or Mario Kart.

                <h2>Computer-assisted music production üéõÔ∏è</h2>
                <p>
                    I've dabbled a bit in computer-assisted music production. My skill level isn't very high because I
                    don't have time to do it regularly, but I love creating little tunes or remixes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's one of my favorite pieces of music that I've never finished: it's a remix of "I am the
                    Doctor" by Murray Gold, a track from the Doctor Who series.
